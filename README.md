# RoboticsLabAssignment2

In this project we will be organising tools within the workspace into a toolbox/drawer/wall mounted tool rack neatly by using a Kinova gen 2 robot with spherical 7 DoF.
There will be emergency features such as sensors placed on the corners of a table which will detect anything that comes within range of the workspace and set off the emergency stop function. GUI will be made for an e-stop and velocity control.
